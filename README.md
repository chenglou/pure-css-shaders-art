# Pure CSS Shaders Art

Shaders art made with pure CSS, with an editable code area also made in CSS, for better eh, developer experience.

The `span`s are arranged into a 2d grid and colored using shader-style coding methods (short, concise code shared across all `span`s, with different CSS variable inputs). This ensures that the CSS art is easy to understand, maintain and modify.

The demos are responsive & editable even on mobile. Check out this repo's various `html` sources.

## FAQ

- **But no one will read and modify these obviously nonsensical pieces of code**: I bet they will! I bet you are =P
- **Ok but why**: I wanted to share shader art in macOS and iOS's Quick Look. Quick Look HTML previews disable JS for security and performance, so CSS was the only option left.
- **Is this a joke**: CSS or shaders?
